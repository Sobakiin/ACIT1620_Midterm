            About Us
        </h2>
        <p>You can call me Yoshikage Kira. 
            I’m currently 33 years old. 
            Not that you’d care, but I reside in northeast 
            Morioh’s villa district. 
            Also, I’ve yet to marry.</p>
        <p>
            In order to make a living, I work for Kame Yu department stores. 
            After a long day’s at work, I return home no later than 8 PM, 
            I don’t like smoking, but do enjoy the occasional drink. 
            I’m always in bed by 11 PM and I make it a point to get no less than 8 hours of sleep each night. 
            Before bed, I drink a warm glass of milk. 
            It’s always coupled with 20 minutes of stretching to decompress from a long workday. 
            Sweet dreams are the usual result of this. 
            I then awake as refreshed and recharged as a newborn child, 
            ready to take on the days challenges. 
            And after my last checkup, I was given a bill of health. 
            For as long as I could remember, 
            I’ve done everything in my power to live a productive life that allows me to pursue a lasting inner peace. 
            This may be a foreign concept, but I choose not to concern myself with winning or losing, 
            life’s troubles , or enemies who bring sleepless nights. 
            That is how I cope with this backwards life we find ourselves living. 
            It’s What brings me happiness in a world fraught with hardship and misery. 
            (This is a reference to something, it doesn't mean anything)
